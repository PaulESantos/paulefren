The R package `redbookperu` serves as a valuable resource for accessing information presented in the publication `The Red Book of Endemic Plants of Peru`. This package facilitates the exploration and analysis of data related to national endemism, a critical concept for assessing and prioritizing strategies for biodiversity conservation. The publication, authored by a collaborative effort involving 43 individuals from 2003 to 2005, delves into the Peruvian endemism, primarily associated with the Andes. It identifies a total of 5,507 taxa restricted to Peru, constituting approximately 27.9% of the country's flora. Notably, `redbookperu` allows  easy access to this valuable information, to contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at monitoring and protecting Peru's endemic plant species
