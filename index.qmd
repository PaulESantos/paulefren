::: {#hero-heading}

I'm a passionate plant ecologist and a dedicated R programming enthusiast.<br>My **research** revolves around the fascinating world of plant traits and innovative code development. In my coding **projects**, I strive to establish a meaningful connection between open-source tools and effective data management, aiming to support fellow researchers in their endeavors.
