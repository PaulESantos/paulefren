    "text": "High-resolution spectroscopy can be used to measure leaf chemical and structural traits. Such leaf traits are often highly correlated to other traits, such as photosynthesis, through the leaf economics spectrum. We measured VNIR (visible-near infrared) leaf reflectance (400–1,075 nm) of sunlit and shaded leaves in ~150 dominant species across ten, 1 ha plots along a 3,300 m elevation gradient in Peru (on 4,284 individual leaves). We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to compare leaf reflectance to chemical traits, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, structural traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), branch wood density and leaf venation, and “higher-level” traits such as leaf photosynthetic capacity, leaf water repellency, and woody growth rates. Empirical models using leaf reflectance predicted leaf N and LMA (r2 &gt; 30% and %RMSE &lt; 30%), weakly predicted leaf venation, photosynthesis, and branch density (r2 between 10 and 35% and %RMSE between 10% and 65%), and did not predict leaf water repellency or woody growth rates (r2&lt;5%). Prediction of higher-level traits such as photosynthesis and branch density is likely due to these traits correlations with LMA, a trait readily predicted with leaf spectroscopy."

    "text": "Forest structure and composition play an essential role in determining the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests. Andean forests, with great potential for carbon accumulation, include large expanses of high-density woody bamboo communities. Woody bamboos can potentially alter forest structure, composition and dynamics and thus can affect carbon storage capacity; however, they are commonly excluded from forest monitoring and modelling. With the aim of documenting patterns of bamboo abundance and disentangling its association with forest structure, we carried out a bamboo census in seven 1-ha long-term forest monitoring plots situated across a large elevation gradient (1000–3600 m a.s.l.) in the Peruvian Andes. We determined that bamboo is a dominant plant group in the study area. In every plot, bamboos were the most common genera in terms of number of stems, and in two of the plots bamboo species were among those with the greatest basal area. We used a combination of Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to hypothesize a causal framework and determine the direction and size of the effects of bamboo abundance (basal area) on number of individual trees, total tree basal area, mean tree basal area, mean tree growth rate and tree mortality rate. We found an overall negative association between bamboo abundance and total tree basal area driven mainly by reduced tree density (directly and indirectly mediated by an increase in tree mortality). However, the decrease in tree density and the increase in tree mortality are also associated with a small increase in tree diameter (mean tree basal area). Overall, the negative association between bamboo abundance and tree basal area suggests a lower biomass accumulation and thus a lower carbon storage capacity of trees in Andean forests where bamboo is dominant.

Long-term climate averages (mean climate) drive spatial variations in species’ baseline growth rates, whereas deviations from these averages over time (anomalies) can create growth variation around the local baseline. However, the rarity of long-term tree census data spanning climatic gradients has so far limited our understanding of their respective role, especially in tropical systems. Furthermore, tree growth sensitivity to climate is likely to vary widely among species, and the ecological strategies underlying these differences remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize an exceptional dataset of 49 years of growth data for 509 tree species across 23 tropical rainforest plots along a climatic gradient to examine how multiannual tree growth responds to both climate means and anomalies, and how species’ functional traits mediate these growth responses to climate. We show that anomalous increases in atmospheric evaporative demand and solar radiation consistently reduced tree growth. Drier forests and fast-growing species were more sensitive to water stress anomalies. In addition, species traits related to water use and photosynthesis partly explained differences in growth sensitivity to both climate means and anomalies.

However, the mechanisms that may be driving such mortality changes and whether particular species are especially vulnerable remain unclear3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we analyse a 49-year record of tree dynamics from 24 old-growth forest plots encompassing a broad climatic gradient across the Australian moist tropics and find that annual tree mortality risk has, on average, doubled across all plots and species over the last 35 years, indicating a potential halving in life expectancy and carbon residence time.

    "text": "Evidence exists that tree mortality is accelerating in some regions of the tropics1,2, with profound consequences for the future of the tropical carbon sink and the global anthropogenic carbon budget left to limit peak global warming below 2 °C. However, the mechanisms that may be driving such mortality changes and whether particular species are especially vulnerable remain unclear3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we analyse a 49-year record of tree dynamics from 24 old-growth forest plots encompassing a broad climatic gradient across the Australian moist tropics and find that annual tree mortality risk has, on average, doubled across all plots and species over the last 35 years, indicating a potential halving in life expectancy and carbon residence time. Associated losses in biomass were not offset by gains from growth and recruitment. Plots in less moist local climates presented higher average mortality risk, but local mean climate did not predict the pace of temporal increase in mortality risk.

Here we integrated several efforts to characterize ~70 years of changes in plant community diversity, functional traits, and ecosystem functioning.

To understand how variability in the timing and strength of the early season drought, temperature, and VPD affects ecosystem carbon exchange through potential shifts in biodiversity and traits, we used a long-term ( ~ 17 year) dataset of peak carbon and water flux measures of vegetation along the same elevational gradient. We test the hypothesis that (i) changing climate, in particular temperature, and (ii) shifts in snowmelt date drive shifts in diversity of plant traits linked to temperature. We next assessed the hypothesis that (iii) shifts in these traits would influence ecosystem carbon and water exchange. Our results show strong shifts in species and trait composition with time and elevation. In the 17 years of monitoring ecosystem functioning we find a strong signal of increased temperatures and minimum VPD. Our results suggest that increasing VPD as well as shifts in plant trait composition together have large effects on the carbon and water budgets in Western mountain watersheds.

    "text": "Abstract\nDeclines in biodiversity have increased the need for better monitoring and quantification of biodiversity. Remote sensing has been used to assess the extent of natural ecosystems and has become an efficient approach to quantify plant biodiversity at larger spatial scales. Imaging spectroscopy have made it possible to quantify plant diversity at high spatial resolution, and has expanded the range of detectable biochemical and physiological plant properties and allowed the quantification of functional traits. Nonetheless, it remains unclear what the most appropriate spatial resolution for remote detection of diversity is, and how the spatial resolution affects distinct diversity components. We quantified three diversity components of plant communities at three different scales in alpine meadows along the East River watershed in Colorado. Our evaluation of scale focuses on variation in the spatial grain (or pixel) rather than the extent of the study area. Specifically, we estimated spectral, functional, and phylogenetic diversity from imaging spectroscopy at the level of leaf, canopy, and from airborne imaging. Diversity for the three components–i.e., functional, phylogenetic, and spectral–was estimated using distance-based metrics. We also evaluated the relationship between diversity metrics derived from spectra and from field-based methods with the long term aim of discerning the most generalizable metrics across scales. Overall, our results in Colorado showed a strong scale-dependency on the relationship between field-based diversity indices and diversity metrics from reflectance as has been found in experimental systems. Spectral diversity calculated at the leaf-level correlates strongly with spectral diversity at the canopy level, but only weakly predicts spectral diversity calculated from airborne imagery (1 m resolution). Three diversity metrics were able to explain variation in plant responses to changes in temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration along the elevation gradient. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the scale dependency of diversity metrics derived from spectra to understand plant responses to environmental gradients and improve the remote detection of diversity from imaging spectroscopy."
