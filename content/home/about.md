# Biography


Hi! I’m a Plant Ecologist and [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>] data enthusiast. I am a biologist from the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco - Peru.

I have worked in tropical forest ecology since 2013. I have gained experience in conservation projects with Frankfurt Zoological Society. I also have collaborated extensively with the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group. [ABERG](http://www.andesconservation.org/) working in the Andes and Amazon regions of Peru such as Manu National Park and surroundings. I participated in projects that evaluated:

- Carbon and forest dynamics.
- Co2 and methane fluxes measuring.
- Plant trait’s ecology.
