# Biography


Hi! I’m Paul, a plant ecologist, and data enthusiast. I am a biologist from the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco - Peru.

I have worked in tropical forest ecology since 2013. I have gained experience in conservation projects with Frankfurt Zoological Society Peru. I also have collaborated extensively with the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group for around 5 years. [ABERG](http://www.andesconservation.org/) working in the Andes and Amazon regions of Peru such as Manu National Park-Peru and surroundings. I participated in projects that evaluated:(i)Carbon and forest dynamics.(ii)Co2 and methane fluxes measuring, and (iii) Plant trait’s ecology.
