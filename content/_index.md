My name is Paul. You can know more about me on the [about](/about/) and [my vitae](/content/vitae/) pages. This blog will cover themes like statistics, data management, and data visualization using R programming language.


All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [turorials](/note/).
