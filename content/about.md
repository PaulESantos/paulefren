Hi! I' m Paul, a plant ecologist, and data enthusiast. I graduated in Biology at the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco - Peru. 

I work in tropical ecology area since undergraduate, I developed my pre-professional practices with Frankfurt Zoological Society Peru. A year after I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Andes Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research Group [ABERG](http://www.andesconservation.org).
Since these time  I'm part of the team of Peruvian student and research assistants of the ABERG projects that are carried out along the elevation transect in Manu National Park-Peru and surroundings. I participated in projects that evaluated: 
 
 - Carbon and forest dynamics.
 - Co2 and methane fluxes measuring.
 - Plant trait's ecology.

CHAMBASA project from [GEM-Trait](http://www.yadvindermalhi.org/projects.html) is one of my favorite research experiences, and it's topic that was covered really captured my interest and give me really nice opportunities. I complete my degree in Biology using leaf level spectral data from this project.

Also, I had the opportunity to collaborate with some mammals ecology project, working with the giant other and black caiman a few years ago, and more recently with Andean bear ecology.
